Contribution
-----------------------------------------------

I created this app because I didn't find in Google Play simple solution for following NASDAQ stocks quotes. Without tons of unuseful functions, services which are westing my battery lifetime and annoying push notifications, I wanted just open the app, check stock quotes, take a look at latest news and close it. And that's exactly what Tiny Stock Quotes doing. Unfortunately I don't have lots of free time right now in order to continue improving app, but I am open for all kinds of contribution. Feel free to copy or modify the code, send pull requests or open bug reports. Also will be great to add ability following other exchanges, i.e MICEX.
